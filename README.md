### Description

Don't have API Viewer freeware program? Don't bother downloading this. However, should you need or want to parse the API Viewer apv files from your code, a module is included in the zip. The parsing engine is fast & pretty well designed. The included interface to show a way of using the engine is not finished & no plans on finishing it. Required: API Viewer *.apv files (not included in zip)
